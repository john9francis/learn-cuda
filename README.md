# Plan for learning cuda
1. Do a simple 3D renderer in c or c++
2. Try and recreate it on cuda via google cloud
3. See if I can get cuda running on my old old laptop with nvidia graphics card
4. Make a nvidia 3D renderer
5. Extend it to a mesh monte carlo algorithm solver
6. Host it on montecarlomodeler


These are lofty goals
